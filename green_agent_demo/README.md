# Green Agent Evaluation Framework Demo

This demo showcases the **Green Agent Evaluation Framework** for crypto trading AI agents in DeFi operations, developed by A10 Team for CS294.

## [DEMO] Demo Overview

The demo demonstrates how our Green Agent evaluates White Agent outputs across multiple DeFi scenarios, providing comprehensive safety and performance assessments.

## [START] Quick Start

Run the interactive demo:

```bash
cd green_agent_demo
python demo.py
```

## [INFO] Demo Components

### 1. Task Introduction
- **Task**: Evaluate crypto trading AI agents in DeFi operations
- **Environment**: Sandbox blockchain with realistic DeFi protocols
- **Actions**: Token swaps, portfolio rebalancing, staking, automated strategies
- **Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional assessment (correctness, safety, efficiency)

### 2. Test Cases Demonstrated

1. **OptimalSwapAgent_v1.0** - Well-designed token swap agent
2. **AggressiveBot_v2.1** - Risky agent with poor safety practices
3. **BalanceBot_v1.5** - Portfolio rebalancing specialist
4. **SafetyFirst_v3.0** - Comprehensive risk assessment agent
5. **FlashArb_v0.8** - Dangerous flashloan arbitrage strategy

### 3. Green Agent Assessment Focus

- **Correctness**: Goal achievement and parameter validation
- **Safety**: Risk factor detection and mitigation
- **Efficiency**: Gas optimization and routing analysis

## [SAFETY] Safety Levels

- **SAFE**: Low risk, approved for execution
- **MODERATE_RISK**: Some risks, proceed with caution
- **HIGH_RISK**: Significant risks, additional validation needed
- **DANGEROUS**: Critical risks, reject execution

## [FEATURES] Key Features Demonstrated

* **Multi-dimensional evaluation** with weighted scoring  
* **Risk factor detection** (slippage, MEV, contract verification)  
* **Transaction simulation** with outcome prediction  
* **Safety classification** with clear thresholds  
* **Actionable recommendations** for improvement  
* **Comprehensive reporting** with detailed analysis  

## [TEST] Test Case Design

Our test cases are designed to evaluate reliability through:

- **Diverse agent types**: From conservative to aggressive strategies
- **Risk spectrum**: Safe operations to dangerous flashloan strategies  
- **Task variety**: All major DeFi operations covered
- **Edge cases**: Unverified contracts and high-risk scenarios
- **Real-world relevance**: Based on actual DeFi protocols

## [OUTPUT] Expected Demo Output

The demo will show:
1. Agent evaluation scores and safety classifications
2. Detailed risk analysis and recommendations
3. Transaction simulation results
4. Summary statistics across all evaluated agents

## [VIDEO] Video Recording Tips

For your 3-minute demo video:
1. Start with task introduction (30 seconds)
2. Show 2-3 concrete evaluation examples (2 minutes)
3. Explain design rationale and conclude (30 seconds)

## [TECH] Technical Implementation

- **Environment**: Simulated DeFi ecosystem with realistic constraints
- **Evaluation Engine**: Multi-criteria decision analysis
- **Safety Framework**: Risk-based classification system
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive analysis with actionable insights
